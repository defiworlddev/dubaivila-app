General Rules

Always use TypeScript for all code.
Use types only for necessary data; avoid over-typing simple or obvious structures.
Follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle: Keep code as simple as possible while achieving the required functionality.
Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module, class, or function should have only one reason to change.

Backend Rules

Maintain the following project structure:

controller/: Handles incoming requests, orchestrates services, and manages responses.
service/: Contains business logic and interacts with data access layers.
dataaccess/: Manages database interactions, queries, and data retrieval/persistence.
model/: Defines data models, schemas, or entities.
utils/: Utility functions, helpers, or shared modules that don't fit elsewhere.


Error handling:

Only use try/catch blocks in controller files to handle errors at the entry point.
In all other files (service, dataaccess, model, utils), throw errors explicitly using throw new Error(...) or custom error classes. Do not catch errors in these layers; propagate them up to the controller.



Frontend Rules

Data management:

Manage local component data and state using React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
Use React Context API for global state management, including sharing data from hooks across components.


Styling:

Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes.
Use SCSS for custom stylesheets where needed (e.g., variables, mixins, or complex selectors).
Do not use inline CSS (no style attributes or objects in JSX).


Ensure all components and hooks are written in TypeScript, following the general typing rule above.
